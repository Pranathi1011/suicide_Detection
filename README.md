# Suicide Detection Using Machine Learning

This project detects suicidal ideation from text using machine learning models.  
It is implemented using Python and deployed with a Streamlit web interface.

## Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Multiple ML models (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting)
- Trained vectorizer and models saved as `.pkl`
- Interactive Streamlit web app

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Pandas, NumPy
- Git & Git LFS
